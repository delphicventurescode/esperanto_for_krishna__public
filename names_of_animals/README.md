## 🐾 Animal Names in Esperanto Influenced by Spanish

Esperanto borrows vocabulary from many languages, including Spanish. Below is a list of animal names in Esperanto that are either directly borrowed from or share strong similarity with their Spanish counterparts — often due to shared Latin roots.

| Esperanto   | Spanish     | English    | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Toro**     | toro        | bull       | Identical in both languages.                                          |
| **Vulturo**  | buitre / *vultur* (Latin) | vulture    | Influenced by Latin; Spanish "buitre" is different, but root is shared. |
| **Tigro**     | tigre       | tiger      | Very similar, minor spelling difference.                             |
| **Kato**     | gato        | cat        | Same root, "k" replaces "g" to fit Esperanto orthography.             |
| **Hundo**    | perro       | dog        | Not from Spanish — derived from Germanic roots.                      |
| **Serpento** | serpiente   | snake      | Strong resemblance; shared Latin root.                               |
| **Elefanto** | elefante    | elephant   | Nearly identical.                                                    |
| **Leono**    | león        | lion       | Very close — Esperanto omits accent and adds -o ending.              |
| **Urso**     | oso         | bear       | Likely not Spanish-derived — more from Slavic or Germanic roots.     |
| **Aglo**     | águila      | eagle      | Not a direct Spanish borrowing, but shares Latin origin.             |

> 💡 **Note**: Esperanto often simplifies and regularizes words from Romance languages. Some similarities are due to common Latin ancestry rather than direct borrowing from Spanish.
